-- Real vs Fake Image Classification using CNN

-- Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as Real or Fake. It demonstrates the application of deep learning and computer vision techniques for binary image classification using supervised learning.

The model learns visual patterns and features from images to accurately distinguish between authentic and manipulated content.
